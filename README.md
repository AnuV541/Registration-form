# Task 1: User Registration Form

This repository contains the implementation of a user registration form, developed according to the specified requirements.

### Key Functionalities:
1. **Field Validation:** Before submission, the form verifies that all required fields are filled. If any required field is empty, an alert is displayed to the user.
2. **Password Confirmation:** The form checks that the "Password" and "Confirm Password" fields match. An alert is shown if the passwords do not align.
3. **Form Submission:** Once all checks are completed successfully, the form is submitted, and a confirmation alert is displayed.

### Design Features:
- **Responsive Layout:** The form is designed to adapt smoothly to various screen sizes using percentages, max-width, and media queries.
- **Aesthetic Buttons:** The buttons have been styled for a visually appealing interface.
- **Content Spacing:** Proper spacing between elements has been applied to enhance readability and usability.

### Validation:
- **HTML5 Validation:** Basic HTML5 validation attributes such as required, pattern, and minlength are implemented.
- **Password Matching:** The "Confirm Password" field is validated to ensure it matches the "Password" field.
